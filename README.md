# Set Up a Turtle Graphics Race Using Object Oriented  

## Introduction  

Reusing code at its finest (debatable). The process of creating a race between turtles (using TUrtle Graphics) can be organized a little more efficiently by approaching the design in an **Object-oriented** way. Since each turtle variable has similar attributes, we can use *generalization* by creating a class with these common attributes. This class tells Python how to make an object representing a turtle. After the creation of the class, you can use it to make individual instances of the class, each of whihc represents one specific turtle object.  

This approach to software design (object-oriented programming) allows you to be more efficient at writing software. Remember, *software* is a collection of programs. This will help you when we see that the turtle race uses more than one python file.  

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is GREAT for modeling real-world stuff. You can think of everything around you (even yourself) as objects, and each of these objects have characteristics and things they can do.
